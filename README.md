# LeggedRobot1
First Wheeled Robot with Knee Joint Project at e-Yantra in Year 2021. Inspired by Ascento Robot, we developed our own robot in an internship program at e-Yantra. I, alongside my colleague Saail Narvekar and Rishikesh Madan guided two of our interns namely Purushotam Kumar Agrawal
and Siddharth Ghodasaran to make the robot.
